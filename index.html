        Welcome to the Direct Labour Model (DLM) Methodology Wiki. This document explains the methodology employed by the DLM to calculate 
        a monthly attribution of drivers in both hours and dollars expensed by VP Operations at the Canada Post Corporation.
        <br>
        <br>
        This document is designed in a similar manner as a website or wiki and allows any user to move through the multi-layered methodology 
        that the DLM uses. It is set up to be highly navigable and presents information in small parts at a time. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The wiki is separated into four parts, which are in line with how the DLM's results are regularily presented. These are:
        <br>
        <a href="Hours/HourMatrix_CD.html">Hours Matrix</a>
        <br>
        <a href="Dollars/DollarMatrix_CD.html">Dollars Matrix</a>
        <br>
        <a href="Driver/Driver_CD.html">Driver View</a>
        <br>
        <a href="Reference/Dollars.html">References</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        These can be selected at any time using the drop down menus above. The Hours and Dollars Matricies and the Driver views are separated 
        by Act Group (CD/MP/CO). Below is a description of each view.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <font size="4">
            <b>Hours Matrix</b>
        </font>
        <br>
        The Hours Matrix corresponds to the <b>hours</b> portion of the tables found on tabs <i>VP Matrix / GM Matrix</i> and the various <i>Director
        Matrix</i> in the Direct Labour Report files. Here the data is divided into Drivers (columns) and Activity Types (Rows). 
        All data is in YOY Hours, with no plan involved.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <font size="4">
            <b>Dollars Matrix</b>
        </font>
        <br>
        The Dollars Matrix corresponds to the <b>dollars</b> portion of the tables found on tabs <i>VP Matrix / GM Matrix</i> and the various <i>Director
        Matrix</i> in the Direct Labour Report files. Here the data is divided into Drivers (columns) and Activity Types (Rows). 
        All data is in YOY Hours, with no plan involved. In addition to the Activity Types used in the Hours Matrix, there are additional 
        Non-Hours Related activities (all data in the DLM is labour-related, but some is not directly tied to a paid hour).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <font size="4">
            <b>Driver View</b>
        </font>
        <br>
        The Driver View corresponds to the <i>ByGM / ByDirector / Driver View</i> tabs in the Direct Labour Report files. Here data is split into 
        drivers for each Act Group and both the YOY Dollar Variance and Plan Dollar Variance are shown. For the most part the calculation refers 
        back to the Dollars Matrix, as the same data is effectively just presented in a new format for the Driver View. 
    </p>

        <br>
        The wiki presents the calculation in a multi-layered manner, with calculations referring other, more basic calculations. The Reference 
        section of the wiki details the most basic concepts and mappings that are preformed to allow for the calculation to be done. This includes
        concepts and mapping of the Act Groups and Time Groups, as well as how and where the base data comes from. As the user clicks through the 
        methodology they will ultimately end up on one of the reference pages, such as the <a href="Reference/Dollars.html">dollars</a> or 
        <a href="Reference/Hours.html">hours</a> reference pages.
